## Overview


This mod adds a new thief kit to the game: the Shuri Ninja.
Created many years ago by Twinblades2, it has been rewritten to the WeiDU modern standard way of coding and ported to Enhanced Editions fames by Aalkaor and Gwendolyne



## Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: aldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition (BGEE), Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, the conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

Though I am striving to make Shuri-Ninja compatible with as many other mods as possible, there is always a chance that incompatibilities will arise. Below are the ones discovered thus far:

- Shuri-Ninja is not compatible with Kit Revisions.


Classical games player are also strongly recommended to download and install the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.



## Installation

#### Notes

<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run <strong>setup-shurininja.exe</strong>, uninstall all previously installed components and delete the shurininja folder.</em>

<em>When installing or uninstalling, <strong>do not close the <acronym title="Disk Operating System">DOS</acronym> window</strong> by clicking on the <strong>X</strong> button! Instead, press the <strong>Enter</strong> key whenever instructed to do so.</em>

<em><strong>Disable any antivirus</strong> or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.</em>


#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.


#### Windows

Shuri-Ninja for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify, using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-shurininja.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>shurininja</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-shurininja.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.

You can run <strong>setup-shurininja.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.

#### Note for Complete Uninstallation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using <strong>setup-shurininja --uninstall</strong> at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.



## Components

The installer includes the following components. The number of each is the component <em>DESIGNATED</em> number which gives it a fixed install position, lets other components detect it and allows automated installers like the BiG World Setup specify component choices.


#### 10. Shuri Ninja Kit (legacy)

Kit Description:
The Shuri Ninjas are those trained by the Shurikai, an organisation of ninja assassins that operate across Kara-Tur. They are quick, deadly, masters of stealth and highly skilled in the use of oriental blades, hand thrown weapons and archery. It is guaranteed if one is marked by the Shurikai they will die that night. Their lethal skills have earned them the respect and intense hatred of Samurai and other rival ninja clans. Very few warriors have crossed blade with a shuri ninja and lived to tell the tale.

Many leave the Shurikai to follow their own paths at the cost of constantly watching their backs for the blades of former comrades. Their services are highly sought after by the western thief guilds if they make it to the western lands alive. None dare double cross them as entire guilds have met their deaths by a single shuri ninja. Due to the rarity of demi-humans in Kara-Tur only humans are trusted with the secrets of Shurikai Ninjutsu.

Advantages:
- 20% bonus to stealth.
- +2 bonus to dexterity.
- At high levels they gain the fighter's special abilities.
- +1 THAC0 and damage every 4 levels.
- +1 bonus to AC every 5 levels.
- Can specialise in katanas, scimitars, daggers, darts and short bows.
- Can place 2 points in single weapon style and 3 points in two-weapon style.

- As the Shuri Ninja increase in level they learn new deadly techniques to aid them in combat or assassination.
  * Level 5 (Blue Belt): They learn to detect illusions using True sight twice a day.
  * Level 10 (Purple Belt): They learn to strike at pressure points with their bare hands twice a day. Opponents get stunned unless they made a save.
  * Level 15 (Red Belt): They learn to maximise the damage they deal for a limited time once a day (Blinding Strike). They gain another use every 10 levels.
  * Level 20 (Brown Belt): They learn the monk's quivering palm which they can use once a day. Opponents will die from the blow unless a save is made (The secret was stolen from an eastern monastery). 
  * Level 25 (Black Belt): They learn to coat their weapons with poison once a day.
  * Level 30: They learn to strengthen their minds against all mental attacks once a day (Chaotic Commands). Their stealth increases by another 20%.
  * Level 35 (First Dan): Their skill in combat increases (+1 bonus THAC0). They can coat their weapons with poison once more a day.

Disadvantages:
- Can't set traps.
- -2 penalty to strength, constitution and charisma.
- Can only use katanas, scimitars, daggers, darts and bows.
- Can't use '2-handed weapon' and 'sword and shield' style.
- Can't dual class.
- Can only be a Chaotic alignment.
- Only humans can become Shuri Ninjas.


The two next components don't need further explanation, I guess. &#128521;
