## Overview


Shuri Ninja kit created by Twinblades2, revised for EE by Aalkaor and Gwendolyne


## Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: aldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition (BGEE), Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, the conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

Though I am striving to make BuTcHeRy compatible with as many other mods as possible, there is always a chance that incompatibilities will arise. Below are the ones discovered thus far:

- Shuri-Ninja is not compatible with Kit Revisions.


You are also strongly recommended to download and install the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.


## Components

The installer includes the following components. The number of each is the component <em>DESIGNATED</em> number which gives it a fixed install position, lets other components detect it and allows automated installers like the BiG World Setup specify component choices.


#### 10. Shuri Ninja Kit (legacy)


SHURI NINJA: The Shuri Ninjas are those trained by the Shurikai, an organisation of ninja assassins that operate across Kara-Tur. They are quick, deadly, masters of stealth and highly skilled in the use of oriental blades, hand thrown weapons and archery. It is guaranteed if one is marked by the Shurikai they will die that night. Their lethal skills have earned them the respect and intense hatred of Samurai and other rival ninja clans. Very few warriors have crossed blade with a shuri ninja and lived to tell the tale.

Many leave the Shurikai to follow their own paths at the cost of constantly watching their backs for the blades of former comrades. Their services are highly sought after by the western thief guilds if they make it to the western lands alive. None dare double cross them as entire guilds have met their deaths by a single shuri ninja. Due to the rarity of demi-humans in Kara-Tur only humans are trusted with the secrets of Shurikai Ninjutsu.

Advantages:
- 20% bonus to stealth.
- +2 bonus to dexterity.
- At high levels they gain the fighter's special abilities.
- +1 THAC0 and damage every 4 levels.
- +1 bonus to AC every 5 levels.
- Can specialise in katanas, scimitars, daggers, darts and short bows.
- Can place 2 points in single weapon style and 3 points in two-weapon style.

- As the Shuri Ninja increase in level they learn new deadly techniques to aid them in combat or assassination.
  * Level 5 (Blue Belt): They learn to detect illusions using True sight twice a day.
  * Level 10 (Purple Belt): They learn to strike at pressure points with their bare hands twice a day. Opponents get stunned unless they made a save.
  * Level 15 (Red Belt): They learn to maximise the damage they deal for a limited time once a day (Blinding Strike). They gain another use every 10 levels.
  * Level 20 (Brown Belt): They learn the monk's quivering palm which they can use once a day. Opponents will die from the blow unless a save is made (The secret was stolen from an eastern monastery). 
  * Level 25 (Black Belt): They learn to coat their weapons with poison once a day.
  * Level 30: They learn to strengthen their minds against all mental attacks once a day (Chaotic Commands). Their stealth increases by another 20%.
  * Level 35 (First Dan): Their skill in combat increases (+1 bonus THAC0). They can coat their weapons with poison once more a day.

Disadvantages:
